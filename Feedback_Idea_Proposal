Thank you for the thoughtful and relevant project proposal â€” using AI to enhance crop yield prediction directly supports SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) and SDG 13 (Climate Action), and your integration of both traditional and deep learning methods is a strong technical direction. The problem is well defined, and your hybrid approach using Random Forest for structured data and CNNs for satellite imagery demonstrates an understanding of the strengths of each method. The inclusion of various data sources such as NASA, FAO, and local reports ensures a solid foundation for your predictive model.

To enhance the novelty and effectiveness of your system, consider incorporating soil sensor data or IoT-based real-time field data, which can give hyperlocal insights and increase precision. You might also explore attention-based models (e.g., Transformers for time series) to capture long-term dependencies in climate patterns more effectively than LSTMs. Additionally, using multi-spectral satellite imagery (e.g., NDVI or SAVI indices) from sources like Sentinel-2 or MODIS can provide deeper insight into vegetation health and correlate better with yield. For real-world application, developing a farmer-facing dashboard or SMS-based alert system could translate your predictions into usable guidance, especially in low-connectivity areas.
